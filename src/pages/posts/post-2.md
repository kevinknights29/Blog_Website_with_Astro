## Microsoft Certified Trainer (MCT)

We all have something to teach, and something to learn from!

In this special date, I want to be thankful and celebrate my certification as a Microsoft Certified Trainer (#MCT).

In this continuous journey of identifying: my strengths, my value proposition, and my mission statement; I've met and interacted with many talented leaders, mentors, and individuals, all from which I'm extremely grateful and thankful for.

From this journey, one thing was common as positive feedback, and that was my ability to communicate and share my knowledge with a great and contagious energy. So much so, that the universe, expose me to becoming a speaker, trainer, and mentor. (Yes, even with a reserved/introvert personality)

Becoming an MCT, represents being of part of a world-class community of trainers, understanding the essence of adult learning (andragogy), and the methods/techniques/frameworks to share knowledge effectively while facilitating learning.

Achieving the MCT status, wouldn't have been possible without the encouragement and guidance from Carlos Sol√≠s Salazar (fun fact: Carlos, also encourage me to get my first cloud certification, and here we are üòÅ).
Massive thanks to tEducaci√≥n for their outstanding training material, coursework and tools.
