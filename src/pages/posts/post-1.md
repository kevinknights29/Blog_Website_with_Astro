## AMALIACONF2023 - Deploying Cloud Base Large Language Models (LLMs) apps in Microsoft Azure

Published on: 2023-11-30

Last Saturday (11/25) I had the opportunity to talk about "Deploying Cloud Base Large Language Models (LLMs) apps in Microsoft Azure" as a speaker, at the AMALIACONF2023 conference hosted by ComunidadDOJO.

With the raising interest of GenAI and LLMs, companies and communities have discovered multiple strategies, products, and services to build LLM applications, nonetheless there is not as much content or discussion in how to deploy these applications for production grade use cases.

I'm very proud to have shared with the audience:

- What are LLMs and their business impact.
- Framework to build LLM applications
- How to deploy LLM applications in Microsoft #azure cloud services.

And to prove the last point, I built a LLM application (as I do with all my talks) deployed in #Azure for the conference that could:

- Generate social content based on uploaded files/information.
- Generate social content in different tones for different platforms.
- Provide visibility of the Vector Search process.

That demo was a major success, differentiated from previous talks, and the audience was interested in having a more in depth session in the future.

And all that, spending almost nothing on OpenAI gpt-3.5-turbo and text-embedding-ada-002; using Qdrant deployed in Azure #Kubernetes Service (AKS), LangChain, and Streamlit deployed in a Docker, Inc container hosted in Azure Container Registry (ACR).
No excuse to not get started building PoCs (prove-of-concept) and MVPs (minimum viable product) with LLMs.

Last, but not least, I am extremely grateful for this opportunity, and I look forward to participating in more conferences and community events future.

Kudos to the organizers for this tremendous event: ComunidadDOJO Juan Chavarría Eduardo Snape Sheila I. Pérez de Ávila.
