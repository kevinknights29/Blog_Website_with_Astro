## PyConnect2023 - Building Generative AI applications for Digital Transformation

Published on: 2023-10-15

Last Saturday (10/14) I had the opportunity to talk about "Building Generative AI applications for Digital Transformation" as a speaker, at the PyConnect2023 conference hosted by Python Panamá.

Generative AI (GenAI) and Large Language Models (LLMs) has taken the world by storm since the release of ChatGPT in November 2022.
The impact of generative AI on economies and enterprise will be revolutionary. McKinsey Global Institute estimates that generative AI will add between $2.6 and $4.4 trillion in annual value to the global economy, increasing the economic impact of AI as a whole by 15 to 40%.
With that said, there is a massive opportunity to drive digital transformation and value generation by creating enterprise wide GenAI tools, that truly democratize AI.

I'm very proud to have shared with the audience:

- What is Gen AI?
- Why Gen AI tools and integrations have been a key business priority worldwide?
- How to build Gen AI applications following a simple framework.

And to prove the last point, I built a GenAI chatbot for the conference that could:

- Provide sessions information and schedule.
- Recommend sessions based on user interests.
- Provide information about the speaker.

That demo was a major success, and many assistants were using through the entire day. It even allowed interaction from online assistants in different countries.
And all that, spending almost nothing on OpenAI gpt-3.5-turbo and text-embedding-ada-002; using Weaviate free tier, LangChain, and Streamlit community cloud (it's amazing).
No excuse to not get started building PoCs (prove-of-concept) and MVPs (minimum viable product) with GenAI.

Last, but not least, I am extremely grateful for this opportunity, and I look forward to participating in more conferences and community events future.
Kudos to the organizers for this tremendous event: José Arnulfo Reyes Hernández, Noel Sánchez.
Kudos to the event's sponsors: JetBrains, Python Software Foundation, softd3v, Pyladies Panama, Noritex S.A.
A massive thanks to my performance coach and biggest supporter (a.k.a. mom): Keyla Knights PMP®, and friends from our internal Data Science and AI community Angel Abel Cruz, Jean Paul Guerra.
